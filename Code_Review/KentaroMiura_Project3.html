At age 18, Miura briefly worked as an assistant to George Morikawa, of Hajime no Ippo fame.

By then, Miura had a dark warrior with a gigantic sword already illustrated in his portfolio.

                Established as one of the best-selling manga of all time, Miura's series Berserk impacted the manga medium and beyond, with journalist Jade King stating: &ldquo;[It] is difficult to overstate the tremendous impact his work has had on the world of games, manga, film, anime, and even literature.&rdquo; The image of Guts and his massive sword is attributed to inspiring characters like Cloud Strife of Final Fantasy VII and Dante from the Devil May Cry series, with the overall aesthetic of Berserk inspiring the monsters and world of the Dark Souls series. Video game director Hideaki Itsuno and producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi are fans of Berserk, and the role-playing hack and slash game Dragon's Dogma includes armor based on Guts and Griffith's.
