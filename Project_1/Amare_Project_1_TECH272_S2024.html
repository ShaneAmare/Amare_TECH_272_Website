<h1>Shane Amare</h1>
<p>I was born in the US, but when I was two I moved to Ethiopia as my father is Ethiopian. I lived there for 16 years, and after I graduated from Highschool, I moved to the US for college. I initially wanted to be a Physics major, but after a lot of thought, and the most difficult decision I have ever made, I decided to change it to Computer Science.</p>
<p>Besides Computer Sceince, I just recently picked up Computer Gaming and Simulation as my double major here in Montgomery College. I aspire to be a game developer and eventually create my own video game in the future. In order to do so, I have started learning <strong>digital art, animation, music composition, sound design, graphic design, and more.</strong> I am still quite new to all of these skills, esspecially graphic design, but I intend on taking my time to learn them thouroughly.</p>
<p>Ten years from now, I hope that I would have already created my dream game, or at least be in the process of developing it. If things dont go well, then I will transition into working under a company, either as a software engineer or a game developer. Assuming things worked out though, I hope to create a small indie game studio where we can make some creative and inspiring games for fellow game developers. I would also like to create <em>free courses</em> for those who would want to join the indie game development journey.</p>
